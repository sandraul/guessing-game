    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Oaxaca, Mexico.
          I grew up eating avocados and mangos everyday, plus many other tropical fruits, and that's one of the things that I miss the most about my hometown.<br>
          I have been living in the USA for 11 years now. I lived in Chicago for three years, enough time to make me want to move to a different place with more nature around it.<br>
          I have two kids, 9 and 6 who keep me busy during the day, all days.</p>

           <li>I have my own small business, it's called Ancestro Products. I produce and sell Poffed Amaranth with the intention to help preserve it as an important Mesoamerican crop.</li>
