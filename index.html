    <h1>Oaxaca's Wonders</h1>
    <h3>A little bit of History</h3>
        <p>Oaxaca: Pronounced 'wə-HAH-kə', comes from the Nahuatl Huāxyacac which means "Land Of Huajes". Huaje is a very common tree in the area.</p><br>
        Oaxaca is located in Southwestern Mexico and it has a significant coastline on the Pacific Ocean.<br>
        The state is best known for its indigenous peoples and cultures. The most numerous and best known are the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs, but there are sixteen that are officially recognized. These two have very important archeological sites such as Monte Albán, and Mitla, with a rich very native culture and crafts. <br>
        Another important tourist area is the coast, which has the major resort of Huatulco and sandy beaches of Puerto Escondido, Puerto Angel, Zipolite and Mazunte. <br>
        Oaxaca is also one of the most biologically diverse states in Mexico for numbers of reptiles, amphibians, mammals and plants.

    <h3>Climate in the Region</h3>
    <p>While the state is within the tropical latitudes, its climate varies with altitude. <br>
      There are three principal climate regions in the state. </p>
      All of these climates experience a rainy season in the summer and early fall. <br>
      As most of the state is over 2,000 m (6,562 ft) above sea level, average temperature is about 18 °C (64.4 °F), except near the coast.

        <ul>
          <li>Hot and Subtropical lands. This accounts for about 30% of the state. </li>
          <li>semi hot and semi humid regions which account for about 18%.</li>
          <li>temperate and semi humid at about 16%.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Nature and conservation</h3>
    <p>Although it is the fifth-largest state in Mexico, it has the most biodiversity. <br>
      There are: </p>
        <ul>
           <li>more than 8,400 registered plant species.</li>
           <li>738 bird species.</li>
           <li>1,431 terrestrial vertebrate species.</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Economy</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Migration: In 45.5% of Oaxaca's municipalities, the population has declined due to migration. </li>
           <li>Agriculture: The production of food staples, such as corn and beans, is mostly for internal consumption but this production cannot meet demand.</li>
           <li>Mining and industry: Currently coal, salt, chalk, petroleum, marble, lime, graphite, titanium, silver, gold and lead are still extracted.</li>
           <li>Commerce: Tourism is important to the state as it is the only sector that is growing and brings substantial income from outside the state, although most tourism is concentrated in the capital and along the coast.</li>
        </ul>
