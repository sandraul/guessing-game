    <h3>About Me</h3>

          I grew up eating avocados and mangoes everyday, plus many other tropical fruits, and that's one of the things that I miss the most about my hometown.<br>
          I have been living in the USA for 11 years now. I lived in Chicago for three years, enough time to make me want to move to a different place with more nature around it.<br>
